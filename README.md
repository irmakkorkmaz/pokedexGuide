i made a pokedex guide,
I placed a search input, I made it as a button in the google search, when we want to search for which pokemon instead of this, it takes the names and shows whether they are equal to the pokemon cards with a value, like a filter, while doing these on the js side.
I did it using Fetch API & Async, Await operations.
